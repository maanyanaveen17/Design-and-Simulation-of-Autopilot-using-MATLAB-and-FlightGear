# Design-and-Simulation-of-Autopilot-using-MATLAB-and-FlightGear
A complete fixed-wing autopilot system built in MATLAB/Simulink, covering aircraft dynamics, control system design, and real-time flight simulation via FlightGear.

This repository presents a comprehensive design and simulation of a fixed-wing aircraft autopilot system developed for the Cessna Skyhawk (C172). The project focuses on modeling aircraft flight dynamics, designing classical control systems, and validating performance through numerical simulation using MATLAB, Simulink, and FlightGear.

The objective of this project is to design a modular autopilot capable of maintaining stable flight by regulating key parameters such as pitch, roll, heading, altitude, and airspeed, while enabling realistic visualization and performance evaluation.
